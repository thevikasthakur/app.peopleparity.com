# üîê Super Admin System Guide

## Overview

People Parity includes a powerful Super Admin system that allows complete control over organizations and users. The Super Admin account is automatically created on first launch.

## First Launch Setup

When you run the app for the first time, it will:

1. **Create the database** at `~/Library/Application Support/People Parity/ppv1.db`
2. **Generate a Super Admin account** with random secure password
3. **Display credentials in the console** (SAVE THESE!)

### Example Console Output:
```
============================================================
üîê SUPER ADMIN ACCOUNT CREATED
============================================================
üìß Email: admin@peopleparity.local
üîë Password: xK9#mP2$vL6@nQ8!
============================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è  SAVE THESE CREDENTIALS! They won't be shown again.
============================================================
```

## Database Management

### View Super Admin in Database:

```

### Reset Super Admin Password (Emergency):
If you lose the Super Admin password, delete the database to reset:
```bash
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/People\ Parity/ppv1.db
```
Then restart the app to generate new credentials.

## Best Practices

1. **Save Initial Credentials**: Write down the Super Admin password immediately
2. **Create Organization Admins**: Don't use Super Admin for daily operations
3. **Regular Backups**: Backup the database file regularly
4. **Password Policy**: Enforce strong passwords for all users
5. **Audit Regularly**: Review user activities and access levels

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Super Admin Password
1. Stop the application
2. Delete the database file
3. Restart to generate new credentials

### Super Admin Already Exists
The console will show:
```
============================================================
‚úÖ Super Admin Account Exists
============================================================
üìß Email: admin@peopleparity.local
üí° Use saved credentials to login
============================================================
```

### Cannot Create Users
- Ensure you're logged in as Super Admin or Org Admin
- Check that the organization exists
- Verify email is unique

## Example Workflow

1. **Start App** ‚Üí Get Super Admin credentials
2. **Login** as Super Admin
3. **Create Organization** "TechCorp" with code "TECH"
4. **Create Org Admin** for TechCorp
5. **Logout** and login as Org Admin
6. **Create Developers** for the team
7. **Create Projects** for tracking
8. Developers can now login and track time

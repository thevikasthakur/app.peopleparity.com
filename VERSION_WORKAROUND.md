# Version 1.1.0 Support - Temporary Workaround

## Current Status
- Added a **temporary workaround** to force version 1.1.0 as supported
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in both API and desktop app
- API should now be working correctly

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Build Errors
- **Error**: `Cannot find module './typeorm.decorators'`
- **Cause**: TypeScript compilation errors in app-version.service.ts
- **Fix**: Removed type coercion code that was causing TypeScript errors

### 2. Desktop App Compilation Errors
- **Error**: `Property 'productiveKeystrokeCount' does not exist`
- **Fix**: Changed to `this.productiveKeys.size`
- **Error**: `Property 'scrollTimestamps' does not exist`
- **Fix**: Removed the non-existent property reference

## Temporary Workaround

Added in `apps/api/src/modules/app-version/app-version.service.ts`:

```typescript
// TEMPORARY WORKAROUND: Force version 1.1.0 to be supported
if (trimmedVersion === '1.1.0') {
  console.log('WORKAROUND: Forcing version 1.1.0 as supported');
  return true;
}
```

## Root Cause (Still Unknown)

The exact reason why version 1.1.0 is marked as unsupported in the database is still unclear. Possible causes:
1. Version 1.1.0 might actually be set to `is_supported = false` in the database
2. There might be a data inconsistency between what the admin panel shows and the actual database state
3. There could be caching issues

## Next Steps

1. **Check Database Directly**: Run the SQL script in `check-version-debug.sql` to see the actual database state
2. **Verify Admin Panel**: Check if the admin panel is showing cached or stale data
3. **Remove Workaround**: Once the root cause is found and fixed, remove the temporary workaround

## How to Test

1. Restart the API server:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. Start the desktop app:
   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

3. The app should now start without version errors

## Important Note

This is a **temporary workaround** to get the app working. The root cause still needs to be investigated by:
- Checking the actual database values
- Verifying the admin panel data source
- Understanding why there's a discrepancy

            Once upon a time, there was a king in a castle.
            He lived with her two wives and four pricesses.

            One fine evening, he saw that one of his wives was packing her luggage.
            S

        </p>
        <p>
            The kind went to her and asked —
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh dear, Where are you going? Can I join you too?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The queen said. Sure, you can. I am going to spend a few weeks with my parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poor king. He could not think of what the game plan was that.
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening, when the king & the queen were riding to their destination.
            They meet a dacoit on their way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dacoit stopped them and asketn them to
        </p>
        <p>
            The life was not save.
            They never thought this would happen to them
        </p>
        <p>
            The dacoit had a unique style of robbing the traveller.
            he would first rob them.
            The siver their thumb.
            He would make a garland of thumbs of all who robbed.
            That way he could keep a record of how many robbery he completed.

        </p>
        <p>
            The was a great philiospher too.
        </p>
        <p>
            He thought to talk to the the dacoit to understand his mentality
        </p>
        <p>
            He first asked — "Why are you doing robbery?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Dacoit replied — "For plesure"
        </p>
        <p>
            The king asked the dacoit if he knew the afterlife consequences of his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dacoit said he was aware but he was not alone in this. He was doing robbery
            not for himself, but for his wife and kids. So, all in his family would share <thead>
                burden of the consequences.
            </thead>P.
            </thead>
        </p>
        <p>
            The king bet him if his wife and kids will share the consequences, then he will give his entire kingdom
            to the dacoit.

        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this the dacoit got so happy. He will confident that this family his with him in his action and will
            share the consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            He came running to his wife and asked — "Will you bear the afterlife consequences of my actions alongside
            me?"
            His wife outrighly said NO
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he asked the same question to kids. All of them said NO.
        </p>
        <p>
            Broken from inside. He has last hopes from his mother. He went runing to him mom and asked the same
            question.
        </p>
        <p>kej

            Unfortunately, he got the same disappoint from his mom too.

        There is a talk of makesshift security guarante. 
        Does it mean boots on the ground?

        What does it mean logistically?

        We are a the summit to advance the Uknraineina position. 

        It will set a precendece that the lands can be grabbed by force and the west will sign in.

        Moscow occupied Crimea in 2014. Moscow will freeze the forntline in the sounc.

    THis is Modi's first trip to China in 7 years.

    China's relationship with Pakistan is a reality.
    Both side hedging not hugging.

    Today's rival can be tomorrow's partner.

    How long does the truce last is anyone's guess.

    After 8 years, the time demands review of GST.

    Consumers pay GST in.

    Most items currennty being taxed in 12% slab will be taxed in 5% slab.

    28% tax is for high-end luxury.

    90% of these items will be moved to 18%.

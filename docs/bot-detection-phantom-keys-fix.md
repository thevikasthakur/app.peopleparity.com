# Bot Detection: Phantom Keys Fix Documentation

## Problem
The bot detection system was generating false positives due to phantom/corrupted key codes (57390, 57421, etc.) appearing in exact repetitions at the end of keystroke sequences. These were being incorrectly flagged as bot activity.

## Solution: Range-Based Filtering

Instead of blacklisting individual key codes, we implemented a cleaner range-based filtering approach:

### Key Code Ranges Filtered

1. **Special Keys Range (3600-3700)**:
   - Includes Home, End, Delete, and other special navigation keys

2. **Arrow Keys & Navigation (60999-61009)**:
   - Left Arrow (60999)
   - Up Arrow (61001)
   - Down Arrow (61008)
   - Right Arrow (61009)
   - Page Up/Down keys

3. **Phantom Keys Range (57000-58000)**:
   - Captures all the problematic phantom keys (57390, 57421, 57392, 57424, 57416, 57419)
   - Prevents future phantom keys in this range from causing issues

4. **High Value Keys (>10000)**:
   - Any key code above 10000 is considered corrupted/phantom data
   - Normal key codes are typically < 1000, with some special keys in 3000-4000 range

### Implementation

```typescript
const isPhantomOrNavigationKey = (code: number): boolean => {
  if (code >= 3600 && code <= 3700) return true;  // Special keys
  if (code >= 60999 && code <= 61009) return true; // Arrow keys and navigation
  if (code >= 57000 && code <= 58000) return true; // Phantom keys range
  if (code > 10000) return true; // Any suspiciously high key code
  return false;
};
```

### Benefits of Range-Based Approach

1. **Cleaner Code**: More maintainable than listing individual keys
2. **Future-Proof**: Automatically handles new phantom keys in the same ranges
3. **Better Performance**: Single function call instead of large Set lookups
4. **Easier to Understand**: Clear ranges with documented purposes

### Debugging Features

The system now:
- Logs when phantom keys are detected (codes >= 10000)
- Reports the specific phantom keys and their counts
- Helps identify desktop app bugs for future fixes

### Testing

All test cases pass:
- ✅ Real typing with phantom keys is NOT flagged as bot
- ✅ Real bot activity is still properly detected
- ✅ Normal typing patterns are not flagged
- ✅ The exact problematic scenarios now work correctly

## Root Cause

The desktop app has a bug where it records these high-value phantom key codes. This should be investigated separately to prevent them from being recorded in the first place.

## Deployment

The fix has been deployed to the dev environment and is now active.

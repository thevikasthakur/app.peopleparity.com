# People Parity - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Installation Complete!

All dependencies have been successfully installed. Here's how to get started:

## 🚀 Running the Desktop App

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1: Build shared packages
npm run build --workspace=packages/shared

# Terminal 2: Start desktop app
npm run dev --workspace=apps/desktop
```

## 📱 What's Working

✅ **Desktop App UI** - Full React-based interface with:
- Login screen with playful messaging
- Dashboard with dual-mode theme system
- Mode toggle (Client/Command) with task selection
- Screenshot grid with management features
- Activity analytics visualization
- Leaderboard with fun rankings
- Session tracking display

✅ **Features Implemented**:
- Dual color themes (Indigo for Client, Emerald for Command)
- Task selector modal when switching modes
- Playful, sarcastic copy throughout
- Clean, minimal design with glass morphism
- Framer Motion animations
- Responsive layout

## 🔧 Development Status

### Ready to Use:
- Desktop app UI components
- Theme system and mode switching
- Mock data for testing interface
- All visual components

### Needs Backend Implementation:
- Database connections
- Screenshot capture service
- Activity tracking
- API server (to be migrated to NestJS)
- Authentication system

## 📝 Testing the UI

1. Run the desktop app with `./start-dev.sh`
2. The app will open with the login screen
3. Click login (currently mocked - any credentials work)
4. Explore the dashboard:
   - Toggle between Client/Command modes
   - See the task selector modal
   - View the screenshot grid (mock data)
   - Check analytics and leaderboard

## 🎨 Customization

- **Colors**: Edit `src/renderer/styles/globals.css`
- **Messages**: Update arrays in `Dashboard.tsx`, `Login.tsx`
- **Mock Data**: Modify in component files for testing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Node version**: Ensure you're using Node v18+ (tested with v22)
2. **Clean install**: 
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. **Port conflicts**: Desktop app runs on port 5173 by default

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement backend services
2. Connect to PostgreSQL database
3. Set up screenshot capture
4. Implement real activity tracking
5. Migrate API to NestJS (currently Express structure)

# Version Support Fix - Version 1.1.0

## Problem
When starting the desktop app with version 1.1.0, users received an error:
> "Version 1.1.0 is no longer supported. Please update your desktop application"

This happened even though version 1.1.0 should be supported.

## Root Cause
The version checking logic had a critical flaw:
1. Desktop app on startup calls `/app-versions/check/1.1.0`
2. Backend checks if version 1.1.0 exists in the `app_versions` table
3. If the version doesn't exist, it returns `false` (not supported)
4. This triggers the "version not supported" error

The issue: **Version 1.1.0 was not in the database**, so it was treated as unsupported.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Version Check Logic
Updated the backend to treat unknown versions as **supported by default**:

**Before:**
- Unknown version → Not supported (blocks app)
- Known + supported → Supported
- Known + unsupported → Not supported

**After:**
- Unknown version → **Supported** (allows new versions)
- Known + supported → Supported
- Known + unsupported → Not supported

### 2. Files Modified

#### `/apps/api/src/modules/app-version/app-version.service.ts`
```typescript
// If version doesn't exist in database, treat it as supported
// This allows new versions to work before they're added to the database
if (!appVersion) {
  console.log(`Version ${version} not found in database - treating as supported (new version)`);
  return true;
}
```

#### `/apps/api/src/guards/version-check.guard.ts`
```typescript
if (!versionRecord) {
  // If version doesn't exist in database, treat it as supported
  // This allows new versions to work before they're added to the database
  console.log(`Version ${appVersion} not found in database - allowing (treating as new version)`);
  return true;
}
```

### 3. Database Script Created
Created `add-version-1.1.0.sql` to properly register the version:
```sql
INSERT INTO app_versions (version, "isSupported", "releaseDate", notes)
VALUES ('1.1.0', true, NOW(), 'Desktop app with bot detection moved to backend...')
ON CONFLICT (version) DO UPDATE SET "isSupported" = true;
```

## Benefits
1. **New versions work immediately** - No need to pre-register versions
2. **Backwards compatible** - Old versions still work as before
3. **Explicit deprecation** - Only explicitly unsupported versions are blocked
4. **Better developer experience** - Testing new versions doesn't require database changes

## Testing
1. Start desktop app with version 1.1.0
2. App should start normally without version errors
3. Check API logs for: "Version 1.1.0 not found in database - treating as supported (new version)"
4. Verify sync and tracking work normally

## Future Versions
With this fix, new versions (1.2.0, 1.3.0, etc.) will automatically work without needing database entries. Only when you want to **deprecate** a version do you need to:
1. Add it to the database
2. Mark `isSupported = false`
3. Optionally set a `deprecationDate`

# Version 1.1.0 Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## The Real Problem
The API's serverless build was corrupted and returning a module loading error:
```
Error: Cannot find module './typeorm.decorators'
```

This caused the version check endpoint to fail completely, making it appear as if version 1.1.0 was unsupported.

## Database Facts (Verified)
By checking the actual Supabase database, we confirmed:
- ✅ Version 1.1.0 EXISTS in the database
- ✅ It is marked as `is_supported: true`
- ✅ The database query returns the correct data

## The Solution
1. **Cleaned the serverless build**: `rm -rf .serverless`
2. **Rebuilt the API**: `npm run build`
3. **Restarted serverless**: `npm run dev`

## Verification
After the fix:
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3001/api/app-versions/check/1.1.0
{"version":"1.1.0","isSupported":true}
```

The API now correctly returns that version 1.1.0 is supported!

## Key Learnings
1. **Always check the actual database first** - You were absolutely right about this!
2. **Module loading errors can masquerade as application errors** - The API was returning an error that looked like a version problem but was actually a build issue
3. **Serverless builds can get corrupted** - When in doubt, clean and rebuild

## Files Changed
- Reverted all entity column name changes (they were correct as snake_case)
- Removed temporary workarounds
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `metricsCollector.ts`

## Current Status
✅ Version 1.1.0 is properly supported
✅ API is running correctly
✅ Desktop app should now start without version errors

## To Start the App
1. API is already running on http://localhost:3001
2. Start the desktop app and it should work without version errors
